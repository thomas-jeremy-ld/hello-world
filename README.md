# hello-world
Living in my own world
Didn't understand that anything can happen
When you take a chance I never believed in
(Oh)
What I couldn't see

I never opened my heart, oh, to all the possibilities, uh
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way and right here tonight
This could be the start of something new

It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart, I feel in my heart
The start of something new
Oh, yeah

Now who'd of ever thought that, oh
We'd both be here tonight
Oh yeah and the world looks so much brighter
Brighter, brighter

Oh, with you by my side, by my side
I know that something has changed
Never felt this way, I know it's for real
This could be the, it's the start of something new

It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
The start of something new

I never knew that it could happen
Till it happened to me, oh yeah
I didn't know it before
But now it's easy to see, oh
It's the start of something new

It feels so right to be here with you, oh
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart
That it's the start of something new

It feels so right
So right to be here with you, oh
And now looking in your eyes
I feel in my heart, I feel in my heart
The start of something new

The start of something new
The start of something new
